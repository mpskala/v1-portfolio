            Hey, I&apos;m Matt 👋🏻. I&apos;m a developer and an avid gym rat
            currently travelling around South East Asia.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up in Manchester, England and went to Manchester Metropolitan
            University, graduating with a degree in Computer Science. I usually
            spend my free time playing games 🎮, at the gym 🏋️‍♀️, listening to
            music 🎵 and enjoying time with friends.
